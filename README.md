# Manga-Downloader
## Requirements
What's needed is : 
- Python ofc
- Pip

And once you have those two run this command
`pip install requests,os,selenium,bs4`

## How it works
The script will load the page through chrome and once everything is downloaded it will load the next chapter and keep going until there isn't any chapter left (meaning you're at the end of the release of your manga)
This for now only works for mangasee.com, **Why?**
If you know any other website who can show the whole chapter in a single page and in the url and has at the end of the url : chapter-number.html

You will also need to provide a file directory for the script
